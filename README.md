Problem/Main Objective: It takes time and resources to build a model from ground up. Therefore, implementing transfer learning by using a pretrained model to predict target outcomes can be better suited. In this project, a CNN model will be built and trained using Cifar10 dataset from ground up. Also, the pretrained model, Mobilenet_v2, will be used on Cifar10 dataset. The performances of each model will be computed and compared. The main objective of this project is to understand how performance differs among a model that is built from ground up vs. a pretrained model.

Dataset Used: The dataset used consists of images of 10 classes, including airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. The data is composed of 60000 images, 50000 for training and 10000 for testing. The images are 32x32x3 pixels. Data can be loaded direclty from Tensorflow or using the link: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

Summary/Methods: The data is divided into train and test samples. The shape of the images in the data are analyzed to confirm the correct shape and size. The unique values of the target variable is checked to confirm their correspondence to each correct class. One hot encoding is used to convert unique values of the target to binary class matrix and feature variables are divided by 255 to normalize the data.
