# Image-Classification-of-Cifar10-Tranfer-Learning
In this project, a pre-trained model, tf2-preview/mobilenet_v2/classification, will be implemented to the cifar10 dataset from TensorFlow, and a new model will be created from the ground up and implemented to the same data. The accuracy scores of both models will be calculated and compared to understand if a pre-trained model works better than a newly created model.
